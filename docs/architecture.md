# System Architecture

## Overview
The Drone Survey Management System is built using a modular, microservices-ready architecture that enables scalability and maintainability.

## Core Components

### 1. API Layer
- Express.js REST API
- Input validation using express-validator
- CORS and security middleware
- Route handlers in controllers

### 2. Data Layer
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Geospatial indexing for location queries
- Structured schemas for:
  - Organizations
  - Drones
  - Missions

### 3. Real-time Updates
- Socket.IO integration
- Mission status broadcasts
- Drone status updates

### 4. Mission Scheduler
- Node-cron for scheduling
- Support for one-time and recurring missions
- Automated drone assignment

## Data Flow
1. Client makes API request
2. Request validation
3. Controller processes request
4. Service layer handles business logic
5. Database operations
6. Real-time updates via Socket.IO
7. Response returned to client

## Security Measures
- Helmet.js for HTTP headers
- CORS configuration
- Input validation
- Error handling middleware

## Scalability Features
- Stateless architecture
- Database indexing
- Pagination
